A few things to consider:

- Look at thenewboston's React-Redux tutorial to further complete building this React-Redux app.
- Install nodemon globally:
	npm install nodemon -g --save
- To run your app:
	1. On one cmd:	npm run build (this runs webpack -w)
	2. On another:	npm run start (this runs nodemon server)
